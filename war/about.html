	<br/>
	<h2 id="ABOUT_MENU_ABOUT_US">About Us</h2>
	<p id="ABOUT_MENU_ABOUT_US_TEXT">
		Wokhei is a startup founded in February 2009 with one simple goal: 
		gather talented graphic designers from all around the globe and 
		make them part of a unique network to offer a truly unique logo service.
		<br/>
		Wokhei is now used every day by Companies, Associations and individuals to create their logos with just a few clicks.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		For us at Wokhei art is not something that can be forced: 
		art doesn't just happen at will within the white walls of an office. 
		Because of its very essence art emerges out of different cultures, 
		traditions and individual intuitions.
		<br/> 
		Art can't be standardized - that's why Wokhei is built on a completely 
		distributed structure.
		<br/> 
		Wokhei truly believes in this and all of the Wokhei designers work from
		their chosen environment: a sunny beach, a rainy forest or - more conventionally - their personal office or studio.
		<br/>
		Wokhei simply channels its associates' creativity - with a twist!

	<h2 id="ABOUT_MENU_WHATWOKHEI">What does Wokhei mean?</h2>
	<p id="ABOUT_MENU_WHATWOKHEI_TEXT">
		Wokhei (wok-hei) is a term in referring to the flavour, 
		taste and ''essence'' imparted by a hot wok on the food.
		<br/> 
		When cooked correctly, the essence of the food comes through 
		the flavour and the dish is said to ''have wok hei''.
		<br/> 
		To impart ''wok hei'', the food must be cooked in a wok over a high flame 
		while being stirred and tossed quickly.
		<br/> 
		In practical terms, the flavour imparted by chemical compounds results 
		from caramelization, Maillard reactions, and the partial combustion of oil 
		that comes from charring and searing of the food at very high heat in excess of 200C degrees. 
		Stir fry technique does not requires as much fat as typical western dishes 
		because of a combination of the metal type and the constant shifting 
		of the food during cook time. 
		As diners usually elect their food with chopsticks from a shared serving bowl, 
		any excess oil remains in the bottom of the serving dish rather than being eaten.

	<h2 id="ABOUT_MENU_DIFFERENTWOKHEI">What is different about Wokhei</h2>
	<p id="ABOUT_MENU_DIFFERENTWOKHEI_TEXT">

		<br/><br/>
		Wokhei is about entrusting designers with the power of surpising the customer.
		<br/><br/>
		Wokhei is a game of creativity for both the customer who requests the logo and the designer who makes it.
		<br/><br/>
		Wokhei is a fresh and experimental approach to logo design!
