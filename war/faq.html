	<h1 id="FAQ_TITLE">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_1">Can I login without a Google Account?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_1_ANSWER">
	No!
	<br/><br/>
	You can access our services only through a Google Account. Why? 
	Because virtually everyone has a Google account and this way you don't have 
	to remember yet another password. Ok, also because we are huge Google fans. 
	<br/><br/>
	Don't worry, the login operation is completely managed by Google, 
	Wokhei does not have access to your password or any other personal info!
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_2">What if I want to slightly modify my logo?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_2_ANSWER">
	Traditional revisions are not part of the Wokhei workflow.
	<br/><br/>
	If you don't like your logo (unlikely but possible) just place another order 
	and cross your fingers. 
	<br/><br/>
	... but, if you are really picky and you would like to suggest
	a small change, there's nothing stopping you from getting creative with tags 
	when submitting a new order for the same logo. It's easy, just tell us what 
	you do or do not like about the logo you just received (i.e. #design_is_ok, #no_blue, etc.).
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_3">How should I use tags when requesting my logo?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_3_ANSWER">
	Tags are descriptive labels you must use to tell us something about your 
	product/business or how you would like your logo.
	<br/> 
	Tags will influence our designers and you can choose a maximum of 5, 
	so make sure to pick them carefully!</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_4">What if I want no text in my logo?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_4_ANSWER">
	If you don't want any text to appear in your logo you still have to specify 
	the product name but you can use the "no-text" tag: by doing this you will 
	receive a graphics-only logo.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_5">When can I download my logo?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_5_ANSWER">
	You will be able to download your logo right after the payment.
	<br/>
	If you decide not to buy you will be able to download it 24hrs after 
	seeing it for the first time.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_6">Why should I buy the logo if I can use it for free?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_6_ANSWER">
	Fair enough!
	<br/>
	Here's the answer: If you don't buy the logo you will be able to use it only 
	under the Wokhei Limited License, which excludes commercial use. 
	Also, if you don't buy your logo someone else can pick it up from the gallery 
	(coming soon) and use it!
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_7">How can I pay for my logo?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_7_ANSWER">
	You can easily pay through Paypal either using your Paypal account or directly 
	via all majors credit cards.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_8">Is Wokhei in any way affiliated with Google?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_8_ANSWER">
	No. Wokhei is powered by the Google App Engine and the Google Web Toolkit 
	but is not affiliated with Google.</p>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="FAQ_9">Is there a limit in how many times I can request the exact same logo?</h2>
	<p id="FAQ_9_ANSWER">
	No, there is no official limit. 
	But our admins have a nice Reject button for that kind of thing, 
	so don't push your luck!</p>
