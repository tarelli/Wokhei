<h1 id="FAQ_TITLE">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_1">Can I login without a Google Account?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_1_ANSWER">No! <br />
<br />

You can access our services only through a Google Account. Why? Because
virtually everyone has a Google account and this way you don't have to
remember yet another password. Ok, also because we are huge Google fans.

<br />
<br />

Don't worry, the login operation is completely managed by Google, Wokhei
does not have access to your password or any other personal info!</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_2">How many revisions can I ask for?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_2_ANSWER">There is no limit to the number of revisions you can ask.<br />
<br />
If you require further changes after the <b>free</b> revision we offer
(unlikely but possible) you can ask for further revisions by tipping us.<br />
<br />
<b>Good news</b>: should you decide to buy at the end of the process the sum of all the revision 
tips will be deducted from the total (98 EUR, VAT incl.).<br />
<b>i.e.</b> You tipped 5 EUR when submitting the order, then used your free revision, then 
requested a second revision and tipped let's say 8 EUR: at the end of the process, should
you decide to buy, you will be billed (98 - 5 - 8) = 85 EUR. <br/>
<br />
<b>Bad news</b>: Should you decide not to buy, you can just walk away at any time - no hard feelings - 
we are aware Wokhei may not be the service for just everyone. Just keep in mind, by definition, 
<b>tips will not be refunded</b>.
</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_3">What's the story with the upfront micro-payment? What am I buying?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_3_ANSWER">You will agree with us that we need to make
sure you really need a logo before we allocate the work to our designers
(otherwise we'd end up doing logos for all sorts of bums out the
street!). <br />
<br />
The micro-payment is just a symbolic token to show us your commitment -
you're buying the effort from our designers to come up with a proposal
based on your logo request. Also the amount of the tip is entirely up to
you and after the micro-payment you have no further obligation towards
Wokhei. <br />
<br />
<b>Good news</b> is the up-front tip will be subtracted from
the total, should you decide to buy!</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_4">Am I obliged to buy the logo?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_4_ANSWER">No! There is no buying obligation, we don't
take any money if you don't like your logo (exception made for the
symbolic tip required to place the order). That's what makes Wokhei so
special! <br />
<br />
If you like you logo and decide to buy it, the amount you transferred to
us in the micro-payment plus eventual additional revisions (should the free one not suffice) 
will be subtracted from the total. <br />
<br />
You will not get back the micro-payment (tip) money though should you decide
not to buy (we'll use it to buy candy for the poor designer whose heart
you broke).</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_5">When can I download my logo and in which formats?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_5_ANSWER">You will be able to download both rasterized
and vectorial version of the logo right after the final payment. <br />

Should you decide to steal the logo with a cheap print screen, prepare
for the worst. We will take it personally and put a bounty hunter on
your tracks!</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_6">Why should I use Wokhei rather than any other logo design service?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_6_ANSWER">Fair question! <br />
The official answer is: because we've got unique designers! 
Just browse through our interactive slide-show on the homepage.<br />
<br />
In case you didn't like the official answer (a bit of a clich√©), here's another one: <b>because
there's no obligation to buy</b>! <br />
<br />
The only thing we ask of you is a symbolic micro-payment upfront, to
make sure you really need a logo. After that, you'll get your logo in
24 hrs, suggest a few changes as part of your free revision and
buy it straightaway if you love it or ask for further changes by tipping us.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell: only a minimal upfront micro-payment to be deducted from total, 
one free revision, unlimited revisions under the same tip formula (also to be deducted from total), 
clockwork 24 hrs service and no buying obligation whatsoever!
</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_7">How can I pay for my logo?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_7_ANSWER">You can easily pay through Paypal either using
your Paypal account or directly via all majors credit cards.</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_8">If I don't like my logo after the free revision, can
I request another revision?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_8_ANSWER">Yes - but you'll have to deposit a symbolic
micro-payment (tip) for each additional revision after the free one.</p>

<br />

<h2 id="FAQ_9">Is Wokhei in any way affiliated with Google?</h2>

<p id="FAQ_9_ANSWER">No. Wokhei is powered by the Google App Engine
and the Google Web Toolkit but is not affiliated with Google.</p>
